    <td>In my memory, I was a flower-loving child since childhood. I often ran to pick roses and jasmine planted by my dad, stringed them up and hung them on my neck or wrists, intoxicated by the gorgeous colors and charming fragrance. I picked up some wildflowers by accident in a few years ago, and enjoyed playing with them. I am always impressed by the beauty of flowers and leaves. I can watch them quietly, listen to the breath of petals, and show the different qualities and beauty of flowers and grass with my own hands. It is really a very happy thing. Unconsciously, I have never taken a flower arranging class, and I actually have hundreds of flower arranging works. Thanks to my dear friends for helping me build this website, open a window to meet friends with flowers, and feel special beauty and happiness. Like this sentence: if you want to choose a way to waste time, then choose flowers. In today's society with a tense competitive environment and fast-paced life, many people often forget to stop and watch their own journey. I hope that through flower arrangements, people can see another beauty in life and enjoy the gifts that nature has given us.</td>
